## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a group of people creating tools for adoption of new technologies in low budget projects like activists networks or various smaller organizations. We do not host software, we create it and give advices about the usage ;-)

Our Kubernetes ecosystem:
- [git-clone-controller](https://github.com/riotkit-org/git-clone-controller) for provisioning of Persistent Volumes from GIT
- [volume-syncing-controller](https://github.com/riotkit-org/volume-syncing-controller) for synchronizing Kubernetes Volumes to a cloud or on-premise storage
- [Space Harbor](https://github.com/riotkit-org/k3s-space-harbor) - lightweight Kubernetes + VPN setup

Our security projects:
- [waf-proxy](https://github.com/riotkit-org/waf-proxy) to guard applications against attacks
- [wordpress-hardened](https://github.com/riotkit-org/wordpress-hardened), WordPress specialized installation automation (docker + helm) with hardening rules, WAF and overall RiotKit ecosystem integration

Our Backup ecosystem:
- [backup-repository](https://github.com/riotkit-org/backup-repository) to store End-To-End encrypted backups in a multi-user environment
- [pgbr](https://github.com/riotkit-org/br-pgbr), a PostgreSQL automation wrapper
- [br-backup-maker](https://github.com/riotkit-org/br-backup-maker), a Backup Repository client
