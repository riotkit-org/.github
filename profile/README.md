## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a group of people creating tools for adoption of new technologies in low budget projects like activists networks or various smaller organizations.

Our Kubernetes ecosystem:
- [git-clone-pperator](https://github.com/riotkit-org/git-clone-operator) for provisioning of Persistent Volumes from GIT
- [volume-syncing-operator](https://github.com/riotkit-org/volume-syncing-operator) for synchronizing Kubernetes Volumes to a cloud or on-premise storage

Our security projects:
- [waf-proxy](https://github.com/riotkit-org/waf-proxy) to guard applications against attacks
- [wordpress-hardened](https://github.com/riotkit-org/wordpress-hardened), WordPress specialized installation automation (docker + helm) with hardening rules, WAF and overall RiotKit ecosystem integration

Our Backup ecosystem:
- [backup-repository](https://github.com/riotkit-org/backup-repository) to store End-To-End encrypted backups in a multi-user environment
- [pgbr](https://github.com/riotkit-org/br-pgbr), a PostgreSQL automation wrapper
- [br-backup-maker](https://github.com/riotkit-org/br-backup-maker), a Backup Repository client
